CREATION HAS SEEN LITTLE LESS WITH NEVER ENDING GRIEF
FOREVER HAS TO WAIT
PEAK AND THEN SUBSIDE
INTO THE UNFADING DARK

I SEE YOU ON EVERY DOOR
DO YOU SEE ME?
DO YOU SEE IT WRITTEN IN THE SKY?

YOU SEE,THE SKY IS SHOWING ITS FADE
COULD THE SKY FALL WHEN THE RAIN WASHED UP?
BUT THE RAINY DAY,MY REMEDY

WILL YOU TWIST MY VISION INTO A PERFECT BLUR?
WILL YOU PULL ME UNDERWATER?
DRAG ME DOWN HEADFIRST?

IT'S JUST BLUNT AND PLAIN
AND NOW WE FAILDE AGAIN
WE CAN'T TRICK THE GRAVITY
SHOULD WE FEEL UNWILLING  OR SHOULD WE CURSE OUR CREATOR FOR THE FATES THAT BEFELL US?

SO BE IT,LET'S JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENS,WHEN THIS SUMMER ENDS...

BUT ONE LAST WORDS BEFORE WE GO
CAUSE WE CAN'T MISS WHAT WE FORGET
SO LET'S JUST PRETEND EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING WAS NEVER HAPPENED

AFTER ALL,SUCCESS WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE
AFTER ALL,WE HAVE ALREADY DONE OUR BEST...
